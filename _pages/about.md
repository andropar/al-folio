 Hi! You're probably here because you want to get to know me a little better. And you found the right place for that :wave:

 I am currently doing my **MSc in Computer Science** at [Leipzig University](https://www.uni-leipzig.de), which I started after a Bachelor in Business Information Systems. During my studies I touched on a broad range of topics, which finally led me to a deeper interest in the practical applications of Machine Learning and its intersection with (Computational) Neuroscience. 

 Right now I am working on my Masters thesis at the [Max-Planck-Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/independent-research-groups/vision-and-computational-cognition) under the supervision of [Martin Hebart](http://martin-hebart.de/) and [Katja MÃ¼ller](http://seeliger.space/). We're building **models of the human visual system** and use them to take a look at the brains inner workings. Fun stuff!

 Next to that, I'm a **Data Science Working Student** at [Check24](https://urlaub.check24.de/), where we use Machine Learning to improve our users travel booking experience and make the lives of our customer service easier. Before that, I implemented Image Search Models at [Webdata Solutions](https://www.webdata-solutions.com/), gave being an Academic Tutor a try (for a course on distributed systems) and had a very good time building a Data Warehouse and Data Processing Pipelines at [Mercateo](http://www.mercateo.com/).
